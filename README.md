# Spotify2Discord
## Send your Current Spotify Song as Playing Status on Discord

### How it Works?
-First Download Spotify2Discord from Releases.
-Get your User Token from Discord, follow the next instructions...
```
1- Open Discord. 
2- Press Ctrl+Shift+i.
3- Click "Application" tab on the inspector.
4- Go to Storage and Expand Local Storage > https://discordapp.com/
5- Find "token" under "Key"
6- Copy the text in quotes on the same row, DO NOT KEEP THE QUOTES                                 
The result should be some like this Mkasdhqiyet1i7euhuwqgerd123y2.t3fu1yi.eo218y7e7wadhi387asdk1 (it's not a real token).
7- Put your token on Token.txt in the same folder of the app.
```
