## Send your Current Spotify Song as Listening to Status on Discord

### How it Works?
- First Download Spotify2Discord from [Here](https://github.com/SonryP/Spotify2Discord/releases).
- Get your User Token from Discord, follow the next instructions...
```
1- Open Discord. 
2- Press Ctrl+Shift+i.
3- Click "Application" tab on the inspector.
4- Go to Storage and Expand Local Storage > https://discordapp.com/
5- Find "token" under "Key"
6- Copy the text in quotes on the same row, DO NOT KEEP THE QUOTES                                 
The result should be some like this Mkasdhqiyet1i7euhuwqgerd123y2.t3fu1yi.eo218y7e7wadhi387asdk1 (it's not a real token).
7- Put your token on Token.txt in the same folder of the app.
```
Token.txt Example
```
Mkasdhqiyet1i7euhuwqgerd123y2.t3fu1yi.eo218y7e7wadhi387asdk1
```
- Open the app and Enjoy the "Msn Messenger Experience".

Note: Maybe you do not see changes in discord, ask a friend if he sees your status changed, or see the discord app on your smartphone.

New: Minimize to tray.

### What I need?:
* Spotify.
* Discord + Your user Token.
* .Net Framework 4.5+.

### This app uses:
* Discord.net - https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net
* Spotify Current Song Function by Gruhlum - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37854194/get-current-song-name-for-a-local-application

### Original idea
https://github.com/DiNitride/Discord-Music-Status

### To-Do:
~~* Logo (in progress...).~~
* Debug the app. (60%?, need your help :3)
* Add custom modes to show the current song (in progress...).
* Add more music players support.
